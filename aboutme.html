        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p class="sophmore">My name is Julie Huynh, and I'm a sophmore at Everest Public High School. In school, my favorite subject is most definitely math. I love the frustration when I don't understand a problem, and I also love feeling accomplished when I finally figure
            out the answer.</p>
        <p class="piano">Outside of school, I love to play the piano or read a book. I started to learn how to play the piano in 3rd grade, but I never really truly enjoyed playing the piano until about 8th grade.</p>
        <p class="food">Another thing that I love to do is eat. My favorite dish that I could eat for days is a Vietnamese dish called Com Tam. Com Tam is a dish that consists of rice and toppings of your choosing, such as grilled pork, fried eggs, and sliced cucumber.
            Then, it is top off with some fish sauce.</p>
        <p class="travel">When I'm not doing those things, I might be traveling with my family. I have traveled to many places such as Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, Australia, France, and many places in the US as well. However, out of all the places I've been to, Hawaii is
            certainly of one of my favorite places to be. I love everything about Hawaii. I love their weather and their beautiful beaches.</p>

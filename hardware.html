                <p class="front" style="border:2px solid black;">RAM stands for random access memory. However, some people also refer to it as the main memory, primary memory, or the system memory. RAM is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly and RAM stores data in the form of 0's
                    and 1's. Programs use the memory stored in the RAM in order for them to run. It's a hardware device that allows information to be stored or retrieved on the computer. RAM requires power to keep the data accessible.</p>

It's the brains for a computer and the CPU is where all calculations take place. A microprocessor is a type of CPU, but not all CPUs are microprocessors.
                    Modern CPUs are small, square and also contain mutiple metallic connectors or pins on the underside. On personal computers, the CPU is contained in a chip called the microprocessor. Then the CPU is inserted, pin side down, into a CPU
                    socket that is located on the motherboard.</p>

        <p id="des-motherboard">The mother board is a printed circuit board that contains the main components of a computer. The motherboard is also known as the mainboard or logic board. The function of the motherboard is to mkae everything work together. Some examples of the
            components on the motherboard are the CPU, memory RAM expansion slots, and USB ports. On a motherboard, there is a chipset, which is a collection of chips and controllers. The circuitry is imprinted or attached to the surface. In addition,
            there is a a chip called the northbridge that is located on the motherboard. The function of the northbridge is to connect and allow for communication between the AGP, CPU, and RAM.</p>

        <h3 id="diskheading">Hard Disks</h3>
        <p id="drive">A hard drive is a high-capacity storage device. A hard drive consists of one or more platters to contain hard disks. Those hard disks are magnetic and store data. The internal hard disks are in a drive bay that is connected to the motherboard
            by an ATA, SCSI or SATA cable. A type of hard drive is the SSD, and SSD stands for solid state drive. The difference between the HDD and the SSD is that the HDD rotates and stores permanent data. Whereas the SSD does not have moving parts
            and stores temporary data. Also, the SSD is faster than the hard disk drive.</p>

        <h4 id="monitorheading">Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse</h4>
        <p id="monitor">The monitor is also referred to as the computer screen and in the monitor, there is a whole bunch of tiny led lights that turn on or off in order to create different colors. Each individual led light is not visible to the naked eye and can only
            been seen underneath a microscope.</p>
        <p id="keyboard">The keyboard is something that takes in physical input and then turns that into digital output. On the keyboard, there are different key that have letters, numbers, punctuation, other special keys. In addition, the keyboard on desktop computers
            is connected to the system unit. There are also different types of keyboards. For instance, there are different switches such as the rubber dome, the mechanical, and the topre. </p>
        <p id="mouse">The mouse is also connected to the system unit and on a simple mouse, there are two buttons at the top. The left mouse is used most often in order to select items on the webpage. The function of the mouse is to control the cursor on the monitor
            of the computer. When you plug in the mouse, the OS (Operating System) automatically recognizes the mouse and is listening for input from the mouse. The mouse is sending 0's and 1's.</p>

        <h2>What is Vindinium?</h2>
            <p>As stated on their website, Vindinium is an "artificial intelligence challenge" which is played against three other players. At the start of the game, the player starts out with zero gold, zero mines, and one hundred health. The goal of the game to end up with the most gold at the end of the game.</p>
        <h3>How do you get gold?</h3>
            <p>Players can obtain gold by claiming mines, which will give them gold for every turn. However, when the player claims the mine, they lose 20 health. When the health reaches a certain low point, the bot can be programmed to go to a tavern, which will give the bot 50 health points in exchange for 2 gold. Lastly, another way to claim mines is to attack other players in order to take over their mines.</p>

                closestBot = enemyBots[i];
            }
        }

        var totalFreeMines = bot.freeMines.concat(minesLocation);
        console.log(totalFreeMines);
    </code></pre>
    <p>This section of my code is where my global data is, which means that I will be able to reference 
    these variables later in my code. In order to find the closest bot, I needed to use a for loop in 
    order for it to loop through all of the enemy bots and comparing their distances to my position. Then,
    I stored that specific enemy bot in a variable. Similarly for determining the position of the enemies' 
    mines, I needed to uses a for loop. However, this time, it was a nested for loop. I needed a nested 
    for loop so that it would first loop through the enemy bots, and then their mines. I pushed the
    positions in an array. I wanted to do this so that I would be able to concat the free mines and the 
    enemy mines into a variable so that my bot would also know how to steal other bots' mines.</p>

    <pre style = width:68% ><code> // This is the decision tree, which tells my bot what task to do based off of my bot's current data
        var task;
        if(bot.drink){
            task = "lowhealth";
            bot.drink = false;
        }
        else if(bot.yourBot.life < 30) {
            bot.drink = true;
            task = "lowhealth";

    <p>This part of my code is the decision tree, that was created using an if...else statement. Therefore, 
    depending on my bot's health, position, and number of mines, a specific task will be assigned to my 
    bot. I chose to organize my decision this way, so that it would prioritize drinking twice when my bot
    has extremely low health. Then, my bot should always be attacking anyone near them if my bot has more
    health than them. Then, my bot should go attack the person with the most mines if their health is good.
    Finally, if none of the other things apply, my bot should go claim free mines.</p>

</code></pre>
    <p>This part of my code tells my bot how to do certain tasks that they are given. For both the task 
    of low health and free mines, I used a for loop to find the closest mine or tavern. Then set my bot's 
    direction to go towards that location. For the task of attacking close, I would just set my bot's 
    direction for to the closest bot. Lastly, for the task of attacking, I calculated the bot that has
    more mines than me and attack them. Otherwise, my bot's task is to go claim a free mine.</p>
    <h6>How did my bot do?</h6>
    <p>In the end, I am very happy of what my bot can do. My bot originally knew how to go to claim the closest free mines. However, I modified this code in order to claim my enemies' mine as well. This means that there are more options for my bot of which mine to claim. In addition, my bot can go to the closest taern. I made a twist on this so that if my bot has all the mines, it will stay at the tavern. That way, if an enemy comes to attack me, I will have enough health. I also programmed for my bot to double drink when they have extremely low health. Furthermore, my bot knows how to attack the players with the most mines only if my bot had more health than them. I did this so that I would be able to gain all of their mines. Lastly, another feature that my bot has is that it will attack anyone that is within 3 squares from them. I did this so that my bot would be the attacker and not the victim bot.</p>
    <h6>My Experience With AI</h6>
    <p>When first starting to program my bot, it was hard because I didn't know where to begin. After looking at the previous code already wirtten for going to the closest mine, I used that to help me build my bot's features. Therefore, as thic project went along, it became easier for me to add different functions, and I was also able to learn and improve my coding abilities in javascript. Finally, after completing this project, I am very happy and proud of how my bot turned outthat I was able to learn something new.</p>

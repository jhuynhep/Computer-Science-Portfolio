                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p id="language">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. This markup language is used to make webpages. In 1990, HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee. HTML is used to add heading, paragraphs, images, and links to a webpage. In a HTML document, it is written by using HTML tags. HTML tags are used to descibe the content in a document. When creating an html document, the first line says <!DOCTYPE html>. This is used in order to tell the browser that the document is in HTML. After writing up all of the codes, the text is saved as an html file and is then viewabale through a browser. </p>

                <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                <p id="sheets">CSS was created by the World Wide Web Consortium. CSS stands for cascading style sheets and CSS is used to style the webpage. CSS is used to style the page such as changing the font, creating a border, or adding special effectws to the page. Often times, there is a separate file for the css that is linked to the html file. This way, all of the codes used to style the page are all in one document.</p>

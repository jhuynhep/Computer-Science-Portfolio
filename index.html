        <p>Welcome to my website! This is a site that I created in order to display the information and knowledge that I have just learned in the first two weeks of Intro to Computer Science. Intro to Computer Science is an expedition course at my school where I am able to learn how a computer works and what the neccessary codes are that make up a program. I am taking this course because I believe that Computer Science will allow me to learn and develop my skills at coding. By the end of this class, I will be able to create a website displaying all the information that I have learned throughout this class, using html, css, and javascrpit. </p>
